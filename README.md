# calendar-application

## this is a calendar app that allows you to locally save to do tasks based on a daily schedule ran by businesses.
- the time starts at 9AM and continues to 5PM.
- the calendar allows you to locally save tasks and recall them when the webpage is recalled. 
- the application will help you keep track of time by color coding tasks based on the current time.
- if the color is gray, that means the task time has passed.
- if the color is red, that means that the task time is in the present.
- if the color is green, that means that the task time is in the future.

## how to use
- First, click anywhere in the text (right of the time slot)
- Second, enter the task at that time slot
- third, click the blue save button to save the task to local storage.
